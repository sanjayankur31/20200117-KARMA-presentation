The present article will focus on the discovery of dendritic spines, which was possible thanks to the application of the Golgi technique to the study of the nervous system, and will also explore the early interpretation of these elements. This discovery represents an interesting chapter in the history of neuroscience as it shows us that progress in the study of the structure of the nervous system is based not only on the emergence of new techniques but also on our ability to exploit the methods already available and correctly interpret their microscopic images."

Here we use a neural model mimicking the cortical anatomy of sensory and motor areas and their connections to explain brain activity indexing auditory change and memory access. Our simulations indicate that while neuronal adaptation and local inhibition of cortical activity can explain aspects of change detection as observed when a repeated unfamiliar sound changes in frequency, the brain dynamics elicited by auditory stimulation with well-known patterns (such as meaningful words) cannot be accounted for on the basis of adaptation and inhibition alone. Specifically, we show that the stronger brain responses observed to familiar stimuli in passive oddball tasks are best explained in terms of activation of memory circuits that emerged in the cortex during the learning of these stimuli. Such memory circuits, and the activation enhancement they entail, are absent for unfamiliar stimuli. The model illustrates how basic neurobiological mechanisms, including neuronal adaptation, lateral inhibition, and Hebbian learning, underlie neuronal assembly formation and dynamics, and differentially contribute to the brain's major change detection response, the mismatch negativity."

NO provides homeostatic control of intrinsic excitability. Here we conduct a theoretical investigation of the distinguishing roles of NO-mediated diffusive homeostasis in comparison with canonical non-diffusive homeostasis in cortical networks. We find that both forms of homeostasis provide a robust mechanism for maintaining stable activity following perturbations. However, the resulting networks differ, with diffusive homeostasis maintaining substantial heterogeneity in activity levels of individual neurons, a feature disrupted in networks with non-diffusive homeostasis. This results in networks capable of representing input heterogeneity, and linearly responding over a broader range of inputs than those undergoing non-diffusive homeostasis. We further show that these properties are preserved when homeostatic and Hebbian plasticity are combined. These results suggest a mechanism for dynamically maintaining neural heterogeneity, and expose computational advantages of non-local homeostatic processes.Received November 28, 2014.Accepted November 29, 2014.{\textcopyright} 2014, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory PressThis pre-print is available under a Creative Commons License (Attribution 4.0 International), CC BY 4.0, as described at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"

These include head direction (HD) cells representing the orientation of the head and grid cells that fire at multiple locations, forming a repeating hexagonal grid pattern. Computational models hypothesize that generation of the grid cell signal relies upon HD information that ascends to the hippocampal network via the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN). We inactivated or lesioned the ATN and subsequently recorded single units in the entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum. ATN manipulation significantly disrupted grid and HD cell characteristics while sparing theta rhythmicity in these regions. These results indicate that the HD signal via the ATN is necessary for the generation and function of grid cell activity."

Such a balance could be established and maintained in an experience-dependent manner by synaptic plasticity at inhibitory synapses. We show that this mechanism provides an explanation for the sparse firing patterns observed in response to natural stimuli and fits well with a recently observed interaction of excitatory and inhibitory receptive field plasticity. The introduction of inhibitory plasticity in suitable recurrent networks provides a homeostatic mechanism that leads to asynchronous irregular network states. Further, it can accommodate synaptic memories with activity patterns that become indiscernible from the background state but can be reactivated by external stimuli. Our results suggest an essential role of inhibitory plasticity in the formation and maintenance of functional cortical circuitry."

A place cell typically fires whenever an animal is present in one or more spatial regions, or places, of an environment. A grid cell typically fires in multiple spatial regions that form a regular hexagonal grid structure extending throughout the environment. Different grid and place cells prefer spatially offset regions, with their firing fields increasing in size along the dorsoventral axes of the medial entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. The spacing between neighboring fields for a grid cell also increases along the dorsoventral axis. This article presents a neural model whose spiking neurons operate in a hierarchy of self-organizing maps, each obeying the same laws. This spiking GridPlaceMap model simulates how grid cells and place cells may develop. It responds to realistic rat navigational trajectories by learning grid cells with hexagonal grid firing fields of multiple spatial scales and place cells with one or more firing fields that match neurophysiological data about these cells and their development in juvenile rats. The place cells represent much larger spaces than the grid cells, which enable them to support navigational behaviors. Both self-organizing maps amplify and learn to categorize the most frequent and energetic co-occurrences of their inputs. The current results build upon a previous rate-based model of grid and place cell learning, and thus illustrate a general method for converting rate-based adaptive neural models, without the loss of any of their analog properties, into models whose cells obey spiking dynamics. New properties of the spiking GridPlaceMap model include the appearance of theta band modulation. The spiking model also opens a path for implementation in brain-emulating nanochips comprised of networks of noisy spiking neurons with multiple-level adaptive weights for controlling autonomous adaptive robots capable of spatial navigation."

	abstract = "The notion of habit used in neuroscience is an inheritance from a particular theoretical origin, whose main source is William James. Thus, habits have been characterized as rigid, automatic, unconscious, and opposed to goal-directed actions. This analysis leaves unexplained several aspects of human behavior and cognition where habits are of great importance. We intend to demonstrate the utility that another philosophical conception of habit, the Aristotelian, may have for neuroscientific research. We first summarize the current notion of habit in neuroscience, its philosophical inspiration and the problems that arise from it, mostly centered on the sharp distinction between goal-directed actions and habitual behavior. We then introduce the Aristotelian view and we compare it with that of William James. For Aristotle, a habit is an acquired disposition to perform certain types of action. If this disposition involves an enhanced cognitive control of actions, it can be considered a “habit-as-learning”. The current view of habit in neuroscience, which lacks cognitive control and we term “habit-as-routine”, is also covered by the Aristotelian conception. He classifies habits into three categories: (1) theoretical, or the retention of learning understood as “knowing that x is so”; (2) behavioral, through which the agent achieves a rational control of emotion-permeated behavior (“knowing how to behave”); and (3) technical or learned skills (“knowing how to make or to do”). Finally, we propose new areas of research where this “novel” conception of habit could serve as a framework concept, from the cognitive enrichment of actions to the role of habits in pathological conditions. In all, this contribution may shed light on the understanding of habits as an important feature of human action. Habits, viewed as a cognitive enrichment of behavior, are a crucial resource for understanding human learning and behavioral plasticity."

The capacity of excitatory synapses to rapidly modify the membrane expression of glutamate receptors in an activity-dependent manner plays a critical role in learning and memory processes by re-distributing activity within neuronal networks. Recent work has however also shown that functional plasticity properties are associated with a rewiring of synaptic connections and a selective stabilization of activated synapses. These structural aspects of plasticity have the potential to continuously modify the organization of synaptic networks and thereby introduce specificity in the wiring diagram of cortical circuits. Recent work has started to unravel some of the molecular mechanisms that underlie these properties of structural plasticity, highlighting an important role of signaling pathways that are also major candidates for contributing to developmental psychiatric disorders. We review here some of these recent advances and discuss the hypothesis that alterations of structural plasticity could represent a common mechanism contributing to the cognitive and functional defects observed in diseases such as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia."

	abstract = "Author Summary Synaptic plasticity is widely believed to be the main mechanism underlying learning and memory. In recent years, several mathematical plasticity rules have been shown to fit satisfactorily a wide range of experimental data in hippocampal and neocortical in vitro preparations. In particular, a model in which plasticity is driven by the postsynaptic calcium concentration was shown to reproduce successfully how synaptic changes depend on spike timing, specific spike patterns, and firing rate. The advantage of calcium-based rules is the possibility of predicting how changes in extracellular concentrations will affect plasticity. This is particularly significant in the view that in vitro studies are typically done at higher concentrations than the ones measured in vivo. Using such a rule, with parameters fitting in vitro data, we explore how long the memory of a particular synaptic change can be maintained in the presence of background neuronal activity, ubiquitously observed in cortex. We find that the memory time scales increase by several orders of magnitude when calcium concentrations are lowered from typical in vitro experiments to in vivo. Furthermore, we find that synaptic bistability further extends the memory time scale, and estimate that synaptic changes in vivo could be stable on the scale of weeks to months."

It is believed that correlations are a consequence of shared inputs between nearby neurons and could severely constrain information decoding. Here we show theoretically that recurrent neural networks can generate an asynchronous state characterized by arbitrarily low mean spiking correlations despite substantial amounts of shared input. In this state, spontaneous fluctuations in the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations accurately track each other, generating negative correlations in synaptic currents which cancel the effect of shared input. Near-zero mean correlations were seen experimentally in recordings from rodent neocortex in vivo. Our results suggest a reexamination of the sources underlying observed correlations and their functional consequences for information processing."

Whether CaMKII activity also controls morphological maturation of optic tectal neurons was tested using in vivo time-lapse imaging of single neurons over periods of up to 5 days. Dendritic arbor elaboration slows with maturation, in correlation with the onset of CaMKII expression. Elevating CaMKII activity in young neurons by viral expression of constitutively active CaMKII slowed dendritic growth to a rate comparable to that of mature neurons. CaMKII overexpression stabilized dendritic structure in more mature neurons, whereas CaMKII inhibition increased their dendritic growth. Thus, endogenous CaMKII activity limits dendritic growth and stabilizes dendrites, and it may act as an activity-dependent mediator of neuronal maturation."

This paper reviews the evidence that neurotransmitters, in addition to their mediation of trans-synaptic information coding, can induce a spectrum of effects on neuronal cytoarchitecture, ranging from neurite sprouting to dendritic pruning and even cell death. Such profound alterations may well constitute a part of the normal functioning and structuring of the nervous system as well as contribute to severe pathological processes."

Here, we investigated the role of calcium signaling in dendritic plasticity by simultaneously recordingcalcium dynamics and filopodial growth in rat hippocampal slice cultures. Local calcium transients occurred in dendriticfilopodia and shafts, often at putative synaptic sites. These events were highly correlated with filopodial motility: comparativelyrare when individual filopodia emerged from the dendrite, they became more frequent after filopodia started growing, finallycausing them to halt. Accordingly, an experimental reduction of the frequency of local calcium transients elicited filopodialgrowth and, conversely, calcium uncaging reduced filopodial motility. Our observations suggest that low levels of local calciumtransients facilitate filopodial outgrowth, whereas high levels inhibit the formation of filopodia and stabilize newly formed ones.This process may facilitate synapse formation and may serve as a homeostatic mechanism distributing synapses evenly alongdeveloping dendrites."

	abstract = "Author Summary
The adult brain is less hard-wired than traditionally thought. About ten percent of synapses in the mature visual cortex is continually replaced by new ones (structural plasticity). This percentage greatly increases after lasting changes in visual input. Due to the topographically organized nerve connections from the retina in the eye to the primary visual cortex in the brain, a small circumscribed lesion in the retina leads to a defined area in the cortex that is deprived of input. Recent experimental studies have revealed that axonal sprouting and dendritic spine turnover are massively increased in and around the cortical area that is deprived of input. However, the driving forces for this structural plasticity remain unclear. Using a novel computational model, we examine whether the need for activity homeostasis of individual neurons may drive cortical reorganization after lasting changes in input activity. We show that homeostatic growth rules indeed give rise to structural and functional reorganization of neuronal networks similar to the cortical reorganization observed experimentally. Understanding the principles of structural plasticity may eventually lead to novel treatment strategies for stimulating functional reorganization after brain damage and neurodegeneration."

A fraction of thin spines appeared and disappeared over a few days, while most thick spines persisted for months. In the somatosensory cortex, from postnatal day (PND) 16 to \{PND\} 25 spine retractions exceeded additions, resulting in a net loss of spines. The fraction of persistent spines (lifetime ? 8 days) grew gradually during development and into adulthood (PND 16–25, 35%; \{PND\} 35–80, 54%; \{PND\} 80–120, 66%; \{PND\} 175–225, 73%), providing evidence that synaptic circuits continue to stabilize even in the adult brain, long after the closure of known critical periods. In 6-month-old mice, spines turn over more slowly in visual compared to somatosensory cortex, possibly reflecting differences in the capacity for experience-dependent plasticity in these brain regions."

Their branching patterns and sizes were stable over times of months. However, axonal branches and boutons displayed cell type-specific rearrangements. Structural plasticity in thalamocortical afferents was mostly due to elongation and retraction of branches (range, 1–150 ?m over 4 days; ?5% of total axonal length), while the majority of boutons persisted for up to 9 months (persistence over 1 month ?85%). In contrast, \{L6\} axon terminaux boutons were highly plastic (persistence over 1 month ?40 %), and other intracortical axon boutons showed intermediate levels of plasticity. Retrospective electron microscopy revealed that new boutons make synapses. Our data suggest that structural plasticity of axonal branches and boutons contributes to the remodeling of specific functional circuits."

A nonreplicative adeno-associated virus bearing the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (AAV.EGFP) provided persistent labeling of axons, and a custom-designed two-photon microscope enabled repeated imaging of the intact brain over several weeks. We found that large-scale branching patterns were stable but that a subset of small branches associated with terminaux boutons, as well as a subset of en passant boutons, appeared and disappeared every week. Bouton losses and gains were both ?7% of the total population per week, with no net change in the overall density. These results suggest ongoing processes of synaptogenesis and elimination in adult V1."

The axon initial segment, the proposed site of action potential generation, usually emanates directly from the soma. However, we found that axons of hippocampal pyramidal cells frequently derive from a basal dendrite rather than from the soma. This morphology is particularly enriched in central CA1, the principal hippocampal output area. Multiphoton glutamate uncaging revealed that input onto the axon-carrying dendrites (AcDs) was more efficient in eliciting action potential output than input onto regular basal dendrites. First, synaptic input onto AcDs generates action potentials with lower activation thresholds compared with regular dendrites. Second, AcDs are intrinsically more excitable, generating dendritic spikes with higher probability and greater strength. Thus, axon-carrying dendrites constitute a privileged channel for excitatory synaptic input in a subset of cortical pyramidal cells."

The basis to this transition is unclear. We investigate it using a biophysical Purkinje cell model under conditions of CF and PF input.

Whereas the synaptic integration can be described in terms of the original Hodgkin-Huxley (H-H) formulations of conductance-based electrical signaling, the transformation of the resulting membrane potential into patterns of spike output is subjected to stochasticity that may not be captured with standard single neuron H-H models. The dynamics of the spike output is dependent on the normal background synaptic noise present in vivo, but the neuronal spike firing variability in vivo is not well studied. In the present study, we made long-term whole cell patch clamp recordings of stationary spike firing states across a range of membrane potentials from a variety of subcortical neurons in the non-anesthetized, decerebrated state in vivo. Based on the data, we formulated a simple, phenomenological model of the properties of the spike generation in each neuron that accurately captured the stationary spike firing statistics across all membrane potentials. The model consists of a parametric relationship between the mean and standard deviation of the inter-spike intervals, where the parameter is linearly related to the injected current over the membrane. This enabled it to generate accurate approximations of spike firing also under inhomogeneous conditions with input that varies over time. The parameters describing the spike firing statistics for different neuron types overlapped extensively, suggesting that the spike generation had similar properties across neurons."

	abstract = "Associative learning of temporally disparate events is of fundamental importance for perceptual and cognitive functions. Previous studies of the neural mechanisms of such association have been mainly focused on individual neurons or synapses, often with an assumption that there is persistent neural firing activity that decays slowly. However, experimental evidence supporting such firing activity for associative learning is still inconclusive. Here we present a novel, alternative account of associative learning in the context of classical conditioning, demonstrating that it is an emergent property of a spatially extended, spiking neural circuit with spike-timing dependent plasticity and short term synaptic depression. We show that both the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli can be represented by spike sequences which are produced by wave patterns propagating through the network, and that the interactions of these sequences are timing-dependent. After training, the occurrence of the sequence encoding the conditioned stimulus (CS) naturally regenerates that encoding the unconditioned stimulus (US), therefore resulting in association between them. Such associative learning based on interactions of spike sequences can happen even when the timescale of their separation is significantly larger than that of individual neurons. In particular, our network model is able to account for the temporal contiguity property of classical conditioning, as observed in behavioral studies. We further show that this emergent associative learning in our network model is quite robust to noise perturbations. Our results therefore demonstrate that associative learning of temporally disparate events can happen in a distributed way at the level of neural circuits."

	abstract = "A complete single-neuron model must correctly reproduce the firing of spikes and bursts. We present a study of a simplified model of deep pyramidal cells of the cortex with active dendrites. We hypothesized that we can model the soma and its apical dendrite with only two compartments, without significant loss in the accuracy of spike-timing predictions. The model is based on experimentally measurable impulse-response functions, which transfer the effect of current injected in one compartment to current reaching the other. Each compartment was modeled with a pair of non-linear differential equations and a small number of parameters that approximate the Hodgkin-and-Huxley equations. The predictive power of this model was tested on electrophysiological experiments where noisy current was injected in both the soma and the apical dendrite simultaneously. We conclude that a simple two-compartment model can predict spike times of pyramidal cells stimulated in the soma and dendrites simultaneously. Our results support that regenerating activity in the apical dendritic is required to properly account for the dynamics of layer 5 pyramidal cells under in-vivo-like conditions."

Such plateau events rely on clustered glutamatergic input, can be mediated by calcium or by NMDA currents, and often generate somatic depolarizations that last for the time course of the dendritic plateau event. We address the computational significance of such single-neuron processing via reduced but biophysically realistic modeling. We introduce a model based on two discrete integration zones, a somatic and a dendritic one, that communicate from the dendritic to the somatic compartment via a long plateau-conductance. We show principled differences in the way dendritic vs. somatic inhibition controls spike timing, and demonstrate how this could implement spike time control in the face of barrages of synaptic inputs."

According to this framework, decision makers accumulate noisy evidence until the running total for one of the alternatives reaches a bound. Lower and higher bounds favor speed and accuracy respectively, each at the expense of the other. Studies addressing the neural implementation of these computations are a recent development in neuroscience. In this review, we describe the experimental and theoretical evidence provided by these studies. We structure the review according to the framework of bounded integration, describing evidence for (1) the modulation of the encoding of evidence under conditions favoring speed or accuracy, (2) the modulation of the integration of encoded evidence, and (3) the modulation of the amount of integrated evidence sufficient to make a choice. We discuss commonalities and differences between the proposed neural mechanisms, some of their assumptions and simplifications, and open questions for future work.

Moreover, protein complexes that regulate spine plasticity depend on specific interactions with membrane lipids for proper function and accurate intracellular signaling. In this review we gather information available on the lipid composition at dendritic spine membranes and on its dynamics. We pay particular attention to the influence that spine lipid dynamism has on glutamate receptors, which are key regulators of synaptic plasticity."

Although primates share many similarities in the organization of their visual centers with other mammals, and even other species of vertebrates, their visual pathways also show unique features, particularly with respect to the organization of the cerebral cortex. Therefore, in order to understand some aspects of human visual function, we need to study non-human primate brains. Which species is the most appropriate model? Macaque monkeys, the most widely used non-human primates, are not an optimal choice in many practical respects. For example, much of the macaque cerebral cortex is buried within sulci, and is therefore inaccessible to many imaging techniques, and the postnatal development and lifespan of macaques are prohibitively long for many studies of brain maturation, plasticity, and aging. In these and several other respects the marmoset, a small New World monkey, represents a more appropriate choice. Here we review the visual pathways of the marmoset, highlighting recent work that brings these advantages into focus, and identify where additional work needs to be done to link marmoset brain organization to that of macaques and humans. We will argue that the marmoset monkey provides a good subject for studies of a complex visual system, which will likely allow an important bridge linking experiments in animal models to humans."

	abstract = "Abstract In biology, homeostasis refers to how cells maintain appropriate levels of activity. This concept underlies a balancing act in the nervous system. Synapses require flexibility (i.e. plasticity) to adjust to environmental challenges. Yet there must also exist regulatory mechanisms that constrain activity within appropriate physiological ranges. An abundance of evidence suggests that homeostatic regulation is critical in this regard. In recent years, important progress has been made toward identifying molecules and signaling processes required for homeostatic forms of neuroplasticity. The Drosophila melanogaster third instar larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) has been an important experimental system in this effort. Drosophila neuroscientists combine genetics, pharmacology, electrophysiology, imaging, and a variety of molecular techniques to understand how homeostatic signaling mechanisms take shape at the synapse. At the NMJ, homeostatic signaling mechanisms couple retrograde (muscle-to-nerve) signaling with changes in presynaptic calcium influx, changes in the dynamics of the readily releasable vesicle pool, and ultimately, changes in presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Roles in these processes have been demonstrated for several molecules and signaling systems discussed here. This review focuses primarily on electrophysiological studies or data. In particular, attention is devoted to understanding what happens when \{NMJ\} function is challenged (usually through glutamate receptor inhibition) and the resulting homeostatic responses. A significant area of study not covered in this review, for the sake of simplicity, is the homeostatic control of synapse growth, which naturally, could also impinge upon synapse function in myriad ways.

Here we focus on the expression of homeostatic plasticity in the chick embryo spinal cord at a stage when \{GABA\} is excitatory. When spinal activity is perturbed in the living embryo there are compensatory changes in postsynaptic \{AMPA\} receptors and in the driving force for \{GABAergic\} currents. These changes are triggered by reduced \{GABAA\} receptor signaling, which appears to be part of the sensing machinery for triggering homeostatic plasticity. We compare and contrast these findings to homeostatic plasticity expressed in spinal systems at different stages of development, and to the developing retina at a stage when \{GABA\} is depolarizing.

Several modes of homeostatic adaptation are known, some of which work at the synaptic level.

Because of this, synaptic downscaling has been hypothesized to counter the potential run-away excitation due to Hebbian type of long term potentiation (LTP), while preserving relative synaptic weight encoded in individual synapses and thus memory information. In this article, we will review the current knowledge on the signaling and molecular mechanisms of synaptic downscaling. Specifically, we focus on three general areas. First the functional roles of several immediate early genes such as Plk2, Homer1a, Arc and Narp are discussed. Secondly, we examine the current knowledge on the regulation of synaptic protein levels by ubiquitination and transcriptional repression in synaptic downscaling. Thirdly, we review the dynamics of signaling molecules such as kinases and phosphatases critical for synaptic downscaling, and their regulation of synaptic scaffolding proteins. Finally we briefly discuss the heterogeneity of homeostatic synaptic downscaling mechanisms. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled ‘Homeostatic Synaptic Plasticity’."

These feedback mechanisms, collectively referred to as “homeostatic plasticity”, enable neurons to respond and adapt to prolonged alterations in neuronal activity by regulating several determinants of cellular excitability. Perhaps the best-characterized of these homeostatic responses involves the regulation of excitatory glutamatergic transmission. This homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) operates bidirectionally, thus providing a means for neurons to tune cellular excitability in response to either elevations or reductions in net activity. The last decade has seen rapid growth in interest and efforts to understand the mechanistic underpinnings of \{HSP\} in part because of the theoretical stabilization that \{HSP\} confers to neural network function. Since the initial reports describing \{HSP\} in central neurons, innovations in experimental approaches have permitted the mechanistic dissection of this cellular adaptive response and, as a result, key advances have been made in our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of HSP. Here, we review recent evidence that outline the presence of distinct forms of \{HSP\} at excitatory glutamatergic synapses which operate at different sub-cellular levels. We further present theoretical considerations on the potential computational roles afforded by local, synapse-specific homeostatic regulation.

The hilus occupies a strategic position within the dentate gyrus from which it can play a pivotal role in these functions. Inputs from dentate granule cells converge on the hilus, and excitatory hilar mossy cells redistribute these signals back to granule cells to transform a pattern of cortical input into a new pattern of output to the hippocampal CA3 region. Using voltage-sensitive dye to image electrical activity in rat hippocampal slices, we explored how long-term potentiation (LTP) of different excitatory synapses modifies the flow of information. Theta burst stimulation of the perforant path potentiated responses throughout the molecular layer, but left responses in the CA3 region unchanged. By contrast, theta burst stimulation of the granule cell layer potentiated responses throughout the molecular layer, as well as in the CA3 region. Theta burst stimulation of the granule cell layer potentiated CA3 responses not only to granule cell layer stimulation but also to perforant path stimulation. Potentiation of responses in the CA3 region reflected NMDA receptor-dependent LTP of upstream synapses between granule cells and mossy cells, with no detectable contribution from NMDA receptor-independent LTP of local CA3 mossy fiber synapses. Potentiation of transmission to the CA3 region required LTP in both granule cell?mossy cell and mossy cell?granule cell synapses. This bidirectional plasticity enables hilar circuitry to regulate the flow of information through the dentate gyrus and on to the hippocampus."

With Fourier analysis and spatial statistics, we analyzed spine position along apical and basal dendrites of layer 3 pyramidal neurons from frontal, temporal, and cingulate cortex. Although we occasionally detected helical positioning, for the great majority of dendrites we could not reject the null hypothesis of spatial randomness in spine locations, either in apical or basal dendrites, in neurons of different cortical areas or among spines of different volumes and lengths. We conclude that in adult human neocortex spine positions are mostly random.

A well-known example is the oculomotor integrator, which anticipates the position-dependent elasticity forces acting on the eye ball by mathematically integrating over time oculomotor velocity commands. Many models of neural integration have been proposed, based on feedback excitation, lateral inhibition or intrinsic neuronal nonlinearities. We report here that a computational model of the cerebellar cortex, a structure thought to implement dynamic models, reveals a hitherto unrecognized integrator circuit. In this model, comprising Purkinje cells, molecular layer interneurons and parallel fibres, Purkinje cells were able to generate responses lasting more than 10 s, to which both neuronal and network mechanisms contributed. Activation of the somatic fast sodium current by subthreshold voltage fluctuations was able to maintain pulse-evoked graded persistent activity, whereas lateral inhibition among Purkinje cells via recurrent axon collaterals further prolonged the responses to step and sine wave stimulation. The responses of Purkinje cells decayed with a time-constant whose value depended on their baseline spike rate, with integration vanishing at low ( 30 per s). The model predicts that the apparently fast circuit of the cerebellar cortex may control the timing of slow processes without having to rely on sensory feedback. Thus, the cerebellar cortex may contain an adaptive temporal integrator, with the sensitivity of integration to the baseline spike rate offering a potential mechanism of plasticity of the response time-constant."

Here we explored the mechanisms of synaptogenesis on neurons born in the adult mouse hippocampus using confocal microscopy, electron microscopy and live imaging. We report that new neurons, similar to mature granule neurons, were contacted by axosomatic, axodendritic and axospinous synapses. Consistent with their putative role in synaptogenesis, dendritic filopodia were more abundant during the early stages of maturation and, when analyzed in three dimensions, the tips of all filopodia were found within 200 nm of preexisting boutons that already synapsed on other neurons. Furthermore, dendritic spines primarily synapsed on multiple-synapse boutons, suggesting that initial contacts were preferentially made with preexisting boutons already involved in a synapse. The connectivity of new neurons continued to change until at least 2 months, long after the form"

The key cell type of this system is the grid cell, whose multiple firing fields span the environment in a remarkably regular triangular or hexagonal pattern. The basic properties of grid cells and other cell types have been described, but the neuronal mechanisms responsible for the formation and maintenance of the place code remain elusive. These mechanisms can be investigated by genetic intervention strategies, where specific components of the entorhinal-hippocampal network are activated or silenced. Because of the common use of knockout mice for such targeted interventions, we asked if grid activity is expressed also in the mouse. Principal neurons in the superficial layers of mouse medial EC had stable grid fields similar to those of the rat. Neighboring grid cells shared a common spacing and orientation but had a different spatial phase, such that a small number of grid cells collectively represented all locations in the environment. The spacing of the grid increased with distance from the dorsal border of the medial EC. The lowest values for grid spacing, recorded at the dorsal end, were comparable to those of the rat, suggesting that grid fields do not scale up proportionally with body size. Grid cells were colocalized with head-direction cells and conjunctive place × head-direction cells, as in the rat. The demonstration of grid cells in mice prepares the ground for transgenic analyses of the entorhinal-hippocampal network. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

In mammals, insights into cortical circuit functions have been obtained for the early stages of sensory systems, where signals can be followed through networks of increasing complexity from the receptors to the primary sensory cortices. These studies have suggested how neurons and neuronal networks extract features from the external world, but how the brain generates its own codes, in the higher-order nonsensory parts of the cortex, has remained deeply mysterious. In this terra incognita, a path was opened by the discovery of grid cells, place-modulated entorhinal neurons whose firing locations define a periodic triangular or hexagonal array covering the entirety of the animal's available environment. This array of firing is maintained in spite of ongoing changes in the animal's speed and direction, suggesting that grid cells are part of the brain's metric for representation of space. Because the crystal-like structure of the firing fields is created within the nervous system itself, grid cells may provide scientists with direct access to some of the most basic operational principles of cortical circuits. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

I answer that the right questions are: What’s different between us and the other primates and what’s the same. I answer the what’s different question by saying that we became symbolic in a way that enabled story understanding, directed perception, and easy communication, and other species did not. I argue against Turing’s reasoning-centered suggestions, offering that reasoning is just a special case of story understanding. I answer the what’s the same question by noting that our brains are largely engineered in the same exotic way, with information flowing in all directions at once. By way of example, I illustrate how these answers can influence a research program, describing the Genesis system, a system that works with short summaries of stories, provided in English, together with low-level common-sense rules and higher-level concept patterns, likewise expressed in English. Genesis answers questions, notes abstract concepts such as revenge, tells stories in a listener-aware way, and fills in story gaps using precedents. I conclude by suggesting, optimistically, that a genuine computational theory of human intelligence will emerge in the next 50 years if we stick to the right, biologically inspired questions, and work toward biologically informed models."

I believe for cognitive robotics to move forward, a balanced approach that emphasizes the interaction of brain, body, and environment is necessary. In general, cognitive robots and cognitive architectures focus too much on brain control, and overlook the contributions of morphology to intelligent behavior. On the other hand, the behavior based robotics approach is unbalanced in the opposite direction. For cognitive robotics to move forward, these disparate research communities need to come into balance. The materials, morphology, sensors, actuators, and the nervous system should be balanced and coordinated in their action. In their book, “How the body shapes the way we think: A new view of intelligence” (MIT Press, 2007), Pfeifer and Bongard have suggested that intelligent agents should follow a set of design principles that highlight the importance of embodiment and physical interaction with the environment. In the present paper, I apply each of these principles to biologically inspired cognitive robotics and suggest how the field can shift toward better cognitive architectures by adherence to these principles."

Four categories of Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures (BICAs) are considered, with multiple examples of each category briefly reviewed, and selected examples discussed in more depth: primarily symbolic architectures (e.g. ACT-R), emergentist architectures (e.g. DeSTIN), developmental robotics architectures (e.g. IM-CLEVER), and our central focus, hybrid architectures (e.g. LIDA, CLARION, 4D/RCS, DUAL, MicroPsi, and OpenCog). Given the state of the art in BICA, it is not yet possible to tell whether emulating the brain on the architectural level is going to be enough to allow rough emulation of brain function; and given the state of the art in neuroscience, it is not yet possible to connect \{BICAs\} with large-scale brain simulations in a thoroughgoing way. However, it is nonetheless possible to draw reasonably close function connections between various components of various \{BICAs\} and various brain regions and dynamics, and as both \{BICAs\} and brain simulations mature, these connections should become richer and may extend further into the domain of internal dynamics as well as overall behavior."

Adult mice lack \{NMDA\} receptor–mediated synaptic currents and long-term potentiation in the \{CA1\} synapses and exhibit impaired spatial memory but unimpaired nonspatial learning.

Although this hypothesis remains unproven, considerable evidence suggests that a particular form of synaptic strengthening, induced by electrical stimulation of certain \{CNS\} fibre systems, may represent the activation of mechanisms that normally subserve associative memory. This phenomenon is known as long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term enhancement (LTE)?. It has been most intensively investigated within the hippocampal formation, a brain structure that plays a crucial role in certain forms of associative memory. Physiological investigation has revealed that \{LTE\} exhibits most of the properties implicit in Hebb's original suggestion that associative memory results from a synaptic strengthening that is contingent upon the conjunction of activity in pre- and post-synaptic elements. In this article, we outline a simple neuronal model capable of superimposing multiple memory traces within the same matrix of connections, and consider the correspondence between such models and the properties of \{LTE\} in the context of the hippocampal circuitry in which it occurs. Certain predictions are derived from this framework concerning the behavioural consequences of experimental manipulation of LTE, and we conclude by describing experimental evidence that confirms these predictions and suggests that \{LTE\} is, in fact, fundamentally involved in memory."

	abstract = "A quantitative computational theory of the operation of the hippocampus as an episodic memory system is described. The \{CA3\} system operates as a single attractor or autoassociation network to enable rapid, one-trial associations between any spatial location (place in rodents or spatial view in primates) and an object or reward and to provide for completion of the whole memory during recall from any part. The theory is extended to associations between time and object or reward to implement temporal order memory, also important in episodic memory. The dentate gyrus performs pattern separation by competitive learning to produce sparse representations, producing for example neurons with place-like fields from entorhinal cortex grid cells. The dentate granule cells produce by the very small number of mossy fibre connections to \{CA3\} a randomizing pattern separation effect important during learning but not recall that separates out the patterns represented by \{CA3\} firing to be very different from each other, which is optimal for an unstructured episodic memory system in which each memory must be kept distinct from other memories. The direct perforant path input to \{CA3\} is quantitatively appropriate to provide the cue for recall in CA3, but not for learning. The \{CA1\} recodes information from \{CA3\} to set up associatively learned backprojections to neocortex to allow subsequent retrieval of information to neocortex, providing a quantitative account of the large number of hippocampo-neocortical and neocortical–neocortical backprojections. Tests of the theory including hippocampal subregion analyses and hippocampal \{NMDA\} receptor knockouts are described and support the theory."

Since both these pathways are constrained by physics, the activity of neural circuits can only be understood by considering biomechanics of muscles, bodies, and the exterior world. We discuss how animal bodies have natural stable motions that require relatively little activation or control from the nervous system. The nervous system can substantially alter these motions, by subtly changing mechanical properties such as body or leg stiffness. Mechanics can also provide robustness to perturbations without sensory reflexes. By considering a complete neuromechanical system, neuroscientists and biomechanicians together can provide a more integrated view of neural circuitry and behavior."

However, it remains to be determined whether the hippocampus critically promotes memory consolidation via the reactivation of individual memories during sleep. To investigate the hippocampal-dependent nature of this phenomenon in humans, we selected two groups of chronic temporal lobe epileptic (TLE) patients with selective unilateral (TLE+UHS) or bilateral (TLE+BHS) hippocampal sclerosis and a group of matched healthy controls, and we requested them to learn the association of sounds cueing the appearance of words. On the basis of other similar behavioral paradigms in healthy populations [4, 6], sounds that cued only half of the learned memories were presented again during the slow-wave sleep stage (SWS) at night, thus promoting memory reactivation of a select set of encoded episodes. A memory test administered on the subsequent day showed that the strengthening of reactivated memories was observed only in the control subjects and TLE+UHS patients. Importantly, the amount of memory strengthening was predicted by the volume of spared hippocampus. Thus, the greater the structural integrity of the hippocampus, the higher the degree of memory benefit driven by memory reactivation. Finally, sleep-specific neurophysiological responses, such as spindles and slow waves, differed between the sample groups, and the spindle density during \{SWS\} predicted the degree of memory benefit observed on day 2. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the hippocampus plays a crucial role in the consolidation of memories via covert reactivation during sleep."

The information from \{HD\} cells is used with place and grid cells to form a spatial representation (cognitive map) of the environment [2, 3]. Previous studies have shown that when rats are inverted (upside down), they have difficulty learning a task that requires them to find an escape hole from one of four entry points but that they can learn it when released from one or two start points [4]. Previous reports also indicate that the \{HD\} signal is disrupted when a rat is oriented upside down [5, 6]. Here we monitored \{HD\} cell activity in the two-entry-point version of the inverted task and when the rats were released from a novel start point. We found that despite the absence of direction-specific firing in \{HD\} cells when inverted, rats could successfully navigate to the escape hole when released from one of two familiar locations by using a habit-associated directional strategy. In the continued absence of normal \{HD\} cell activity, inverted rats failed to find the escape hole when started from a novel release point. The results suggest that the \{HD\} signal is critical for accurate navigation in situations that require a flexible allocentric cognitive mapping strategy, but not for situations that utilize habit-like associative spatial learning."

	abstract = "Many different species of animals including mole rats, pigeons, and sea turtles are thought to use the magnetic field of the earth for navigational guidance. While laboratory rats are commonly used for navigational research, and brain networks have been described in these animals that presumably mediate accurate spatial navigation, little has been done to determine the role of the geomagnetic field in these brain networks and in the navigational behavior of these animals. In Experiment 1, anterior thalamic head direction (HD) cells were recorded in female Long-Evans rats while they foraged in an environment subjected to an experimentally generated magnetic field of earth-strength intensity, the polarity of which could be shifted from one session to another. Despite previous work that has shown that the preferred direction of HD cells can be controlled by the position of familiar landmarks in a recording environment, the directional signal of HD cells was not influenced by the polarity of the magnetic field in the enclosure. Because this finding could be attributed to the animal being insensitive or inattentive to the magnetic field, in Experiment 2, rats were trained in a choice maze task dependent on the ability of the animals to sense the polarity of the experimentally controlled magnetic field. Over the course of 28 days of training, performance failed to improve to a level above chance, providing evidence that the spatial behavior of laboratory rats (and the associated HD network) is insensitive to the polarity of the geomagnetic field.

	abstract = "The head direction cell system is capable of accurately updating its current representation of head direction in the absence of visual input. This is known as the path integration of head direction. An important question is how the head direction cell system learns to perform accurate path integration of head direction. In this paper we propose a model of velocity path integration of head direction in which the natural time delay of axonal transmission between a linked continuous attractor network and competitive network acts as a timing mechanism to facilitate the correct speed of path integration. The model effectively learns a “look-up” table for the correct speed of path integration. In simulation, we show that the model is able to successfully learn two different speeds of path integration across two different axonal conduction delays, and without the need to alter any other model parameters. An implication of this model is that, by learning look-up tables for each speed of path integration, the model should exhibit a degree of robustness to damage. In simulations, we show that the speed of path integration is not significantly affected by degrading the network through removing a proportion of the cells that signal rotational velocity."

The model's performance was tested by supplying single-frequency sinusoidal stimuli as input and measuring the gain and phase of the output waveforms generated. Network parameters were tuned for optimum performance at two different input frequencies and the model was tested across a range of frequencies. Gain and phase relationships generated by the model correspond in general to those observed in the normally functioning reflex, but the frequency tuning of the network is much narrower. The significance of these results in relationship to other models of the vestibulo-ocular reflex is discussed"

A previous study that compared cell firing during clockwise and counterclockwise head turns concluded that ATN ‘head direction’ (HD) cell discharge anticipates the rat's future directional heading, while PoS HD cell discharge is in register with the rat's current directional heading (Blair and Sharp [1995] J Neurosci 15:6260–6270). In the current study we extend these findings by using a different method of analysis. HD cells in the ATN and PoS were first characterized by three different measures: peak firing rate, range width, and information content. We then examined how these measures varied when cell firing was aligned with past (negative time shift) or future (positive time shift) head direction of the rat. We report that all three measures were optimized when ATN cell firing was aligned with the animal's future directional heading by about +23 msec. In contrast, PoS HD cell firing was optimized when cell firing was aligned with the rat's past head direction by about -7 msec. When the optimal value was plotted as a function of the amount of time spikes were shifted relative to head orientation, the mean ATN function was shifted to the right of the PoS function only at negative time shifts; at positive time shifts the two functions overlapped. Analysis of two recording sessions from the same cell indicated that each cell in a particular brain area is ‘tuned’ to a specific time shift so that all cells within a brain area are not uniformly tuned to the same time shift. Other analyses showed that the clockwise and counterclockwise tuning functions were not skewed in the direction of the head turn as postulated by Redish et al. ([1996] Network: Computation in Neural Systems 7:671–685) and Blair et al. ([1997] J Neurophysiol 17:145–159). Additional analysis on episodes when the rat happened to continually point its head in the preferred direction indicated that HD cell firing undergoes little adaptation. In the Discussion, we argue that these results are best accounted for by a motor efference copy signal operating on both types of HD cells such that the copy associated with the PoS HD cells is delayed in time by about 30 msec relative to the copy associated with ATN HD cells.

	abstract = "In real bio-systems, animals can combine multiple independent sources of information (sensory cues) to reduce uncertainty and improve perceptual performance. Despite intense recent interest in cue integration, the underlying neural mechanisms remains unclear. Continuous attractor neural network (CANN) can be interpreted as an efficient framework for implementing population coding and decoding. In this work, we show that CANN can account for many empirical principles in multisensory integration. Viewed from single neuron behaviors, CANN model can account for the principle of inverse effectiveness and the spatial principle. From the perspective of the activities of population of neurons, CANN can account for the mathematical rule by which multisensory neurons combine their inputs with respect to different cue reliabilities."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We present a straightforward procedure for aligning positive face examples for training. To collect negative examples, we use a bootstrap algorithm, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting nonface training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of nonface images. Simple heuristics, such as using the fact that faces rarely overlap in images, can further improve the accuracy. Comparisons with several other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented, showing that our system has comparable performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates",

Here, we examine the morphologies, wiring, and architectures of single synapses of projection neurons in the murine hippocampus that developed in virtually complete absence of vesicular glutamate release. While these neurons had smaller dendritic trees and/or formed fewer contacts in specific hippocampal subfields, their stereotyped connectivity was largely preserved. Furthermore, loss of release did not disrupt the morphogenesis of presynaptic terminals and dendritic spines, suggesting that glutamatergic neurotransmission is unnecessary for synapse assembly and maintenance. These results underscore the instructive role of intrinsic mechanisms in synapse formation.",

ABSTRACT={A key challenge in cortical neuroscience is to gain a comprehensive understanding of how pyramidal neuron heterogeneity across different areas and species underlies the functional specialization of individual neurons, networks and areas. Comparative studies have been important in this endeavor, providing data relevant to the question of which of the many inherent properties of individual pyramidal neurons are necessary and sufficient for species-specific network and areal function. In this mini review, the importance of pyramidal neuron structural properties for signaling are outlined, followed by a summary of our recent work comparing the structural features of mouse (C57/BL6 strain) and rhesus monkey layer 3 (L3) pyramidal neurons in primary visual and frontal association cortices and their implications for neuronal and areal function. Based on these and other published data, L3 pyramidal neurons plausibly might be considered broadly “generalizable” from one area to another in the mouse neocortex due to their many similarities, but major differences in the properties of these neurons in diverse areas in the rhesus monkey neocortex rules this out in the primate. Further, fundamental differences in the dendritic topology of mouse and rhesus monkey pyramidal neurons highlight the implausibility of straightforward scaling and/or extrapolation from mouse to primate neurons and cortical networks.}

    ABSTRACT={Astrocytes are commonly involved in negative responses through their hyperreactivity and glial scar formation in excitotoxic and/or mechanic injuries. But, astrocytes are also specialized glial cells of the nervous system that perform multiple homeostatic functions for the survival and maintenance of the neurovascular unit. Astrocytes have neuroprotective, angiogenic, immunomodulatory, neurogenic, and antioxidant properties and modulate synaptic function. This makes them excellent candidates as a source of neuroprotection and neurorestoration in tissues affected by ischemia/reperfusion, when some of their deregulated genes can be controlled. Therefore, this review analyzes pro-survival responses of astrocytes that would allow their use in cell therapy strategies.}

The analysis reveals a rich repertoire of states, including synchronous states in which neurons fire regularly; asynchronous states with stationary global activity and very irregular individual cell activity; and states in which the global activity oscillates but individual cells fire irregularly, typically at rates lower than the global oscillation frequency. The network can switch between these states, provided the external frequency, or the balance between excitation and inhibition, is varied. Two types of network oscillations are observed. In the fast oscillatory state, the network frequency is almost fully controlled by the synaptic time scale. In the slow oscillatory state, the network frequency depends mostly on the membrane time constant. Finite size effects in the asynchronous state are also discussed.",

	abstract = {We review a body of theoretical and experimental research on Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity, starting from a puzzling observation: while homeostasis of synapses found in experiments is a slow compensatory process, most mathematical models of synaptic plasticity use rapid compensatory processes (RCPs). Even worse, with the slow homeostatic plasticity reported in experiments, simulations of existing plasticity models cannot maintain network stability unless further control mechanisms are implemented. To solve this paradox, we suggest that in addition to slow forms of homeostatic plasticity there are RCPs which stabilize synaptic plasticity on short timescales. These rapid processes may include heterosynaptic depression triggered by episodes of high postsynaptic firing rate. While slower forms of homeostatic plasticity are not sufficient to stabilize Hebbian plasticity, they are important for fine-tuning neural circuits. Taken together we suggest that learning and memory rely on an intricate interplay of diverse plasticity mechanisms on different timescales which jointly ensure stability and plasticity of neural circuits.This article is part of the themed issue {\textquoteleft}Integrating Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity{\textquoteright}.},

abstract = "Following loss of input due to peripheral lesions, functional reorganization occurs in the deprived cortical region in adults. Over a period of hours to months, cells in the lesion projection zone (LPZ) begin to respond to novel stimuli. This reorganization is mediated by two processes: a reduction of inhibition in a gradient throughout the cortex and input remapping via sprouting of axonal arbors from cortical regions spatially adjacent to the LPZ, and strengthening of pre-existing subthreshold inputs. Together these inputs facilitate receptive field remapping of cells in the LPZ. Recent experiments have revealed time courses and potential interactions of the mechanisms associated with functional reorganization, suggesting that large scale reorganization in the adult may utilize plasticity mechanisms prominent during development.

abstract = "Summary A fundamental property of neuronal circuits is the ability to adapt to altered sensory inputs. It is well established that the functional synaptic changes underlying this adaptation are reflected by structural modifications in excitatory neurons. In contrast, the degree to which structural plasticity in inhibitory neurons accompanies functional changes is less clear. Here, we use two-photon imaging to monitor the fine structure of inhibitory neurons in mouse visual cortex after deprivation induced by retinal lesions. We find that a subset of inhibitory neurons carry dendritic spines, which form glutamatergic synapses. Removal of visual input correlates with a rapid and lasting reduction in the number of inhibitory cell spines. Similar to the effects seen for dendritic spines, the number of inhibitory neuron boutons dropped sharply after retinal lesions. Together, these data suggest that structural changes in inhibitory neurons may precede structural changes in excitatory circuitry, which ultimately result in functional adaptation following sensory deprivation.
